# Microsoft Academic Graph PySpark Samples

PySpark examples running on Azure Databricks to analyze sample Microsoft Academic Graph Data on Azure storage.

## Prerequisites

Before running these examples, you need to complete the following setups:

* Setting up provisioning of Microsoft Academic Graph to an Azure blob storage account. See [Get Microsoft Academic Graph on Azure storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/academic-services/graph/get-started-setup-provisioning).

* Setting up Azure Databricks service. See [Set up Azure Databricks](https://docs.microsoft.com/academic-services/graph/get-started-setup-databricks).

## Gather the information that you need

   Before you begin, you should have these items of information:

   :heavy_check_mark:  The name of your Azure Storage (AS) account containing MAG dataset from [Get Microsoft Academic Graph on Azure storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/academic-services/graph/get-started-setup-provisioning.md#note-azure-storage-account-name-and-primary-key).

   :heavy_check_mark:  The access key of your Azure Storage (AS) account from [Get Microsoft Academic Graph on Azure storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/academic-services/graph/get-started-setup-provisioning.md#note-azure-storage-account-name-and-primary-key).
   
   :heavy_check_mark:  The name of the container in your Azure Storage (AS) account containing MAG dataset.
   
   :heavy_check_mark:  The name of the output container in your Azure Storage (AS) account.
